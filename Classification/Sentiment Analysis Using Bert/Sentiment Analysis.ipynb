Around four or five places from the top, you'll get a text to come back to the restaurant, where you'll be seated pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Although my wife has been to Marufuku dozens of times, this is my first visit, and it certainly won't be my last. After about a 45-minute wait on a Saturday night, we were treated to some of the most delicious Hakata-style ramen I've had in the city. We first ordered a couple of Sapporo draft beers ($6.75), a large sake ($9), and an order of Japanese-style fried chicken ($7) as well as the fried shishito ($6). Then, I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX ($18.50), which means that it's like the regular Hakata Tonkotsu but bigger. And if that isn't big enough, you can always order extra toppings. Personally, I thought the menu serving was fine, but it's always nice to have options. My wife, having already eaten lunch at Marufuku, decided to go with the smaller Mentaiko Bowl ($5).<br/><br/>Ambiance is great - lot's of dark wood. Very much a reminder of traditional restaurants I've eaten at in Japan. Service was fantastic. Everyone is very nice and responsive when you need more water, extra toppings, or more chopsticks when one of yours inevitably falls on the floor. And don't worry about asking for the check. They're so busy that they will tactfully have you paid up before your last few bites so that they can turn your table over for the next eagerly waiting customer.<br/><br/>For sure, when visiting Japantown, give Marufuku a try. Just be sure you aren't starving when you arrive, because it may be another hour before you're seated - especially on weekend nights.</span></p>]"

Around four or five places from the top, you'll get a text to come back to the restaurant, where you'll be seated pretty quickly.Although my wife has been to Marufuku dozens of times, this is my first visit, and it certainly won't be my last. After about a 45-minute wait on a Saturday night, we were treated to some of the most delicious Hakata-style ramen I've had in the city. We first ordered a couple of Sapporo draft beers ($6.75), a large sake ($9), and an order of Japanese-style fried chicken ($7) as well as the fried shishito ($6). Then, I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX ($18.50), which means that it's like the regular Hakata Tonkotsu but bigger. And if that isn't big enough, you can always order extra toppings. Personally, I thought the menu serving was fine, but it's always nice to have options. My wife, having already eaten lunch at Marufuku, decided to go with the smaller Mentaiko Bowl ($5).Ambiance is great - lot's of dark wood. Very much a reminder of traditional restaurants I've eaten at in Japan. Service was fantastic. Everyone is very nice and responsive when you need more water, extra toppings, or more chopsticks when one of yours inevitably falls on the floor. And don't worry about asking for the check. They're so busy that they will tactfully have you paid up before your last few bites so that they can turn your table over for the next eagerly waiting customer.For sure, when visiting Japantown, give Marufuku a try. Just be sure you aren't starving when you arrive, because it may be another hour before you're seated - especially on weekend nights.\"]"
