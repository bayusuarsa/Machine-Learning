I uploaded this dataset from the following link: http://biogps.org/dataset/tag/brca1/

The dataset contains information on breast cancer patients, including their Patient_ID, Age, Gender, and expression levels of four proteins (Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4). The dataset also includes the Breast cancer stage of the patient (Tumor_Stage), Histology (type of cancer), ER, PR, and HER2 status, Surgery_type, Date of Surgery, Date of Last Visit, and Patient Status (Alive/Dead).

This information can be used to analyze the relationship between protein expression levels, cancer stage, and patient outcomes. It can also be used to understand the impact of different types of surgeries on patient survival and to identify potential risk factors for breast cancer progression.
